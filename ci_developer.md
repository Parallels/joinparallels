Hiring manager: [Ekaterina Firsova](mailto:staff@parallels.com)


Parallels CI Team is responsible for building a system that composes final product from source code on a continuous basis. The system is built around Jenkins, Artifactory, Rundeck and our own internally developed services in a way that makes most use of community code. It builds our code for almost all popular platforms: OS X, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android.
As of now, our main goal is to standardise the approach for building code across different product teams and provide a self-service build system for the entire company.

## Your first year goal ##

Implement a Packer-based system for composing build VM images and deploying them to the hypervisor. We already have Chef cookbooks that set up standardised build environments, but all layers above it are yet to be implemented.
Implement a system that is able to replace build VMs based on what envrironments are currently needed by active products.

Together with the rest of the team you will also support the codebase of our products, set the standards for dependency management, build frameworks, code signing, and help implementing them.

## Desired qualifications ##

- Good knowledge of a high-level mainstream language (preferred: Python, Ruby, Go, Java)
- Ability to read C/C++ code and fix minor bugs in it
- (optional) Prior experience implementing or extending Jenkins/TeamCity/Bamboo plugins
- Conceptual understanding of various build frameworks (GNU Make, Qmake, SCons, CMake and others)
- Good understanding of git
- Ability to test your own code
